# Rubik's Cube Solver Robot

This is the codebase for my Rubik's Cube-solving robot, built as a personal project to combine my skills in mechanical design, coding, and robotics.

## Files
- `Arduino_Motor_Control.ino`: Arduino code to control the stepper motors
- `Python_Color_Input.py`: Python script for reading cube colors and sending rotation commands

## How it works
The Python script interfaces with the Arduino to read the cubeâ€™s colors, generate a solving sequence, and control the motors to turn each face accordingly.

## Tools Used
- Arduino UNO  
- Python  
- SolidWorks (for mechanical design)  
- Stepper motors & drivers  
- 3D printed components

## Demo
